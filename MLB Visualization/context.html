        <h2>Data Scources</h2>
        <p>
            The data used in this project has been sourced from the Sean Lahman Baseball Database (<a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/" target="_blank">http://www.seanlahman.com/</a>). The Lahman dataset is an extensive collection of baseball statistics that includes information on over 21,000 players throughout the history of Major League Baseball. This rich dataset provided us with player statistics spanning 1871 to 2023 such as games played, runs scored, hits, and other critical metrics that are displayed in our visualizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The baseball card images were compiled by scraping the Baseball Almanac website (<a href="https://www.baseball-almanac.com/" target="_blank">https://www.baseball-almanac.com/</a>). Using this approach, we were able to obtain nearly 10,000 player images, which we use to complement the statistical data from the Lahman dataset. These images add a visual element that makes it easier to connect statistics to real players, enhancing the overall experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the players that we were unable to find images for, we use a default placeholder image. This ensures that every player represented in our dataset has some form of imagery, even if specific photos are unavailable. The combination of comprehensive player data and visual elements provides a more engaging and informative experience for users exploring Major League Baseball history and statistics.
