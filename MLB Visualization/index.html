    <h2>Trading Cards</h2>
    <p>Baseball collectors have long prized player trading cards based on rarity and quality. Cards of the game's best players could fetch millions of dollars, but how can we objectively judge players? On the backs of trading cards, you'd find critical stat information for a given player. This popularized counting stats like the ones shown in the table below. </p>

    <h2>Rate Statistics</h2>
    <p>This evolved into rate statistics like Batting Average (BAA), On-Base Percentage (OBP), and Slugging (SLG) that attempted to quantify a batter's performance on a per opportunity basis.</p>

    <h2>Modern Statistics</h2>
    <p>However, modern sabermetricians are focused on winning behaviors. Thus, we redefined our offensive production metrics not to evaluate hits or bases, but runs and wins. wOBA of a player uses linear weights to assign run values to each type of event when players attempt to reach via a hit.</p>
